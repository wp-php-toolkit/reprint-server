/**
 * PDO polyfill for hosts without the PDO extension.
 *
 * The reprint-server codebase references PDO::* constants, \PDOException,
 * and \PDOStatement at multiple call sites (see the design spec for an audit).
 * On hosts without ext-pdo, those references would fatal at runtime even
 * though the wpdb adapter is the chosen connection.
 *
 * This file conditionally defines those names in the global namespace so
 * existing code can resolve them without modification. Constant values
 * match the real PDO extension exactly so behavior is identical regardless
 * of which is loaded.
 *
 * Side-effect note: on PDO-less hosts, class_exists('PDO') with the default
 * autoload-true argument now returns true. Co-resident code that uses
 * class_exists('PDO') as an optional-feature gate (skip PDO path if false)
 * will see the polyfill and try to use it, fataling where it previously
 * skipped cleanly. This is acceptable for the exporter's deployment surface
 * but documented here so a reader can grep for it.
 *
 * The eval() below is load-bearing. Do not rewrite these as plain conditional
 * class declarations, however much they want to be.
 *
 * This package declares a directory classmap ("classmap": ["src/"]). Composer's
 * ClassMapGenerator strips strings before it tokenises for class declarations,
 * so a class inside an eval()'d heredoc is invisible to it and never reaches
 * the generated map. Jetpack's AutoloadGenerator calls the same generator, and
 * its map is site-global — shared by every plugin using its autoloader. Declare
 * these three names outside a string and PDO, PDOStatement and PDOException
 * land in that map, where every other plugin's class_exists('PDO') resolves to
 * this polyfill.
 *
 * exclude-from-classmap in composer.json covers Composer's own autoloader, and
 * the test suite and the standalone plugin use it. It does not help on Jetpack:
 * AutoloadGenerator::parseAutoloads() emits no exclude-from-classmap key, so
 * AutoloadProcessor applies no exclusions. There, the eval() is the only thing
 * keeping these names out.
 *
 * tests/PdoPolyfillTest.php tokenises this file and fails if it declares a
 * class where a scanner can see one.
